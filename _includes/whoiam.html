                <p>My research focuses on how to bring the <span class="highlight">processing of large amounts of data</span> closer to domain experts, independently of their computational skills. To this end, it is necessary to develop new mechanisms that <span class="highlight">facilitate the use of data science techniques and technologies to computing non-experts</span> by, e.g., reusing and adapting generic data-intensive techniques to specific application domains, enabling the high level definition of complex data processing applications or managing their execution over the most suitable computing platforms in a transparent way.</p>
